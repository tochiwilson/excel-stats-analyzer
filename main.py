# Load an Excel File and Get Basic Stats
# Description:
# Create a script that loads an Excel file and calculates statistics
# such as the mean, sum, maximum, and minimum of numerical columns.
# Provide an overview of column names, the number of rows, and the number of missing values per column.
#
# Challenge:
# Add data visualizations. Use the matplotlib or pandas library to generate graphs,
# such as histograms for numerical columns or a boxplot to visualize the spread.
# This helps make the statistics more insightful.
